### Security
#### Localstorage
- Accessible from JS?	 ✅ Yes — can be accessed via window.localStorage	
- Vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?	❌ Yes	
- Vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?	✅ No (not sent automatically with requests)	
- Can use SameSite flag?	❌ No	
- Can be marked as HttpOnly (not accessible to JS)?	❌ No

#### Session
- Accessible from JS?	⚠️ Depends — accessible only if not HttpOnly
- Vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?	❌ Yes if not HttpOnly, ✅ Safer if HttpOnly
- Vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?	❌ Yes (sent with every request by default)
- Can use SameSite flag?  ✅ Yes (helps mitigate CSRF)
- Can be marked as HttpOnly (not accessible to JS)?	✅ Yes (more secure)

#### Best practice
- If security is a top concern (e.g., banking app):
   - Store JWT in a HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie.
   - This prevents XSS (JavaScript can’t access it) and limits CSRF with proper flags.
- If building a SPA (Single Page App) and want control in frontend:
   - Store JWT in localStorage or sessionStorage.
   - But make sure to sanitize input to prevent XSS.


#### ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- Storing tokens in localStorage without XSS protection
  - → Can lead to full account takeover if site is vulnerable.
- Using cookies without SameSite and HttpOnly
  - → Susceptible to CSRF and XSS both.
