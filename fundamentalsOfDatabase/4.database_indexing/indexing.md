- what is indexing
> - An index is is a data structure that you build and you assign on top of an existing table that basically looks through your table and then tries to analyze it and summarize it so that it it can create kind of shortcuts

- simple example like phone book labeled with a, b ,c where all the names starting with a will be stored in that section

## Two type of indexing (these are the data structure which basically help you to search through table effectively)
- b-trees
- LSM trees
