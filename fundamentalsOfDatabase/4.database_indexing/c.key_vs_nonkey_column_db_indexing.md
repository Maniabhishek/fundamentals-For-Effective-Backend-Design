- when you want to create an index in Postgres or in any other database, you specify a field or more than one field to index to create that b-tree on top of it right. And that key will be used for searching purposes. And when you do a search on that index, the database planner, will use that index and search for that. And the entries that found in the index will contain row pointers to point back to the table to fetch the actual rows. where we will have more than one field there.
- Non-key indexes are the abilities, where you can effectively create an index and create Non-key, include some columns inside the index not to search for, but to include. So in this case, if you select like you created an index on the age field, right? And you can optionally include other fields in the index like the ID.
