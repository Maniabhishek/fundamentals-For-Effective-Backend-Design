## Atomicity (All or Nothing)
> Ensures that a transaction is either fully completed or not executed at all.
If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
âœ… Example:
A bank transfer:
```sql

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Deduct from A
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Add to B
COMMIT;
```
If the second update fails (e.g., due to a network issue), the first update is rolled back

## Consistency (Valid State Before & After Transaction)
> The database must always remain in a valid state.
Every transaction must follow integrity constraints (like foreign keys, unique constraints).

> âœ… Example:
If a transaction inserts a student into a course, the student must exist in the Student table.
Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency.

## Isolation (Concurrent Transactions Don't Interfere)
>Ensures transactions do not affect each other when running concurrently.
Uses isolation levels to control how changes are visible to other transactions.

###ğŸ”¹ Isolation Levels in PostgreSQL:
- READ UNCOMMITTED â€“ Transactions can see uncommitted changes. (Rarely used)
- READ COMMITTED (Default in PostgreSQL) â€“ Only committed changes are visible.
- REPEATABLE READ â€“ Ensures that if a transaction reads data once, it sees the same data throughout.
- SERIALIZABLE â€“ The strictest level, transactions are executed as if they were sequential.
> âœ… Example:
Two transactions trying to book the last movie ticket:

```sql
-- Transaction 1
BEGIN;
SELECT seats FROM movie_tickets WHERE movie_id = 1001; -- Sees 1 seat available
UPDATE movie_tickets SET seats = seats - 1 WHERE movie_id = 1001;
COMMIT;

-- Transaction 2 (Runs at the same time)
BEGIN;
SELECT seats FROM movie_tickets WHERE movie_id = 1001; -- Also sees 1 seat available
UPDATE movie_tickets SET seats = seats - 1 WHERE movie_id = 1001;
COMMIT;
```

> If no isolation is applied, both transactions see 1 seat and book it, leading to overbooking (data inconsistency).
Using SERIALIZABLE isolation, PostgreSQL prevents such conflicts.


## Durability (Permanent Storage)
> Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently saved, even if the system crashes.
PostgreSQL ensures durability using WAL (Write-Ahead Logging).
#### âœ… Example:
> If a power failure occurs after a transaction is committed, the changes remain in the database when the system restarts.
