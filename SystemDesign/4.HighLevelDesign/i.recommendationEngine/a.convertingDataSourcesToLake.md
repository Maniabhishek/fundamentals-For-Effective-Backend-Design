### Data warehouse
- Place where we store all our data collected from business to make some analysis , prediction, using these datas we can create recommendation engine 
- for example we have a e-com website then we will have many databases line order, items, tracking, profile, cart
- now we will collect all these data and store this in data lake , and plus we will have cron job to periodically push the latest data to data lake
- then we can have machine learning system which can read the data from the data lake, and run machine learning algorithm over these data to get more insights
