### Lets discuss about how we will store the images
- well there are couple of way we store the images, first is BLOB (binary large object) or as file
- to decide between these lets see what are the benefits we get
- to store it as a blob we are going to be storing it in DBs
- now what benefits does the dbs give us
   - Mutability (changing the data in a row)
   - Transactions (ACID)
   - Indexes (search)
   - Access control
- do we need any of these capability for images , mutability are you going to be updating or changing the text of the binaries
- trasactions properties are also not required
- Indexes we are never going to be searching based on image text
- access control will be same as implementing in both
- if we save images as file what are the benefits we will get
    -  it can be cheaper
    -  it will be faster
    -  CDNs
- so this concludes we will be storing the images in distributed file systems
- so in our db we will create a table with column [ProfileId, ImageId, FileUrl]
