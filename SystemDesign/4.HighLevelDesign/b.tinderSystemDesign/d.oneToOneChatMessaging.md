### Lets discuss about the one to one chat messaging 
- how are we going to develop it , here a client has to talk to another client if they have a match together
- lets think a client talk to server via a http protocol , server cannot talk back to client and ask for data
- so in order to make a client communicate to another client we need to use XMPP protocol (Extensive Messaging and Presence Protocol)
- what will happen internally , XMPP makes a connection over Websocket basically you can also say you are going to make a connection over TCP and you are going to maintain it
