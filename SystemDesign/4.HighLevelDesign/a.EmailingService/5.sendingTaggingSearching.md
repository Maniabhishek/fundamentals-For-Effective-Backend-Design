- we will have one email store which will have the API to send email
- in this email store we will store all the users emails (userid, from toUsers, CC , timestamp)
- and the content of the email will be store in different table , (userid, content)
- we will have something called spam detector
- so we can either have it as cron job or everytime the new emails comes we will keep sending these mails in message queues
- spam detector will keep on pulling messages from here
- searching emails what can we do , we need to be able to search throught emails from to subject, or content , or tagged table created by spam detector we either join these table and search at once but that could be terrible, instead we will use search engine like elastic search
