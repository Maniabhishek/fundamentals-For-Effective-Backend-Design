- users will connect to our system through an application or web
- users will first connect to a Gateway
- what will gateway do
    - it will route the request to the right service
    - if some attackers tries to flood the system with request then Gateway service blacklist these IPs
    - Translates request
- so when the users types emailingService.com it will query the DNS and get the IP address of our Gateway server


- now there is some problem our gateway server is doing a lot to improve we can decouple this service to create a new service called service manager
- service manager will manage and give us service mapping of different routes
- so the request first comes to gateway server and then gateway server fetches the service mapping from service manager
- then it will make request to the required service


- lets do the registeration of user through the auth service
- emailingService.com/auth?username=abc&password=xyz anything with auth will go to auth service these information is stored in service manager service
- gateway server gets the server which is auth server , where this request will go
- auth service will validate data and store the username, password and phone now we will also verify the user using sms
- now how is this sms going to be sent to the user , we will have sms service which will take care of all the different kind of sms to be sent to the user, it will have different templates for different types of SMSs
- once verified we will save this info in db
- now user registeration is done and once verified it return the reponse and now user can have different code to login , this code will be stored with timestamp
