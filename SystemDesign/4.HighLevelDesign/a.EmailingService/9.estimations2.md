### Restate the problem (interview habit)

#### Estimating 1PB of data processing if each MB take 5 I/O reads of 20ms each
- We have 1 PB of data.
- For each 1 MB, the service performs 5 I/O reads.
- Each I/O read takes 20 ms for 1 MB.
- We want to estimate processing time and required compute.

### Convert everything to the same unit
- Data size
- 1 PB = 1,000 TB
-      = 1,000,000 GB
-      = 1,000,000,000 MB
- 
- So total data = 1 billion MB

### Calculate total I/O operations
- For each 1 MB → 5 reads
- Total reads = 1,000,000,000 MB * 5
-             = 5,000,000,000 I/O reads
- 👉 5 billion I/O operations

### Calculate total I/O time (single-threaded, worst case)
- Each read takes:
- 20 ms = 0.02 seconds
- Total time:
- 5,000,000,000 × 0.02 seconds
- = 100,000,000 seconds

### Convert time into human-readable units
- 100,000,000 seconds
- ≈ 27,778 hours
- ≈ 1,157 days
- ≈ ~3.17 years
- 👉 If done sequentially on ONE worker, this would take ~3.2 years
- 📌 This is the “shock number” interviewers want you to discover

### Interview insight: this is I/O-bound, not CPU-bound
- At this point you say:
- “This workload is I/O bound, not compute bound. CPU is mostly waiting on disk/network.”
- That shows senior-level thinking.

### Parallelism (how real systems survive)
- Now you introduce horizontal scaling.
- Example: 1,000 parallel workers
- Total time / workers
- = 100,000,000 / 1,000
- = 100,000 seconds
- ≈ 27.8 hours
- 👉 With 1,000 workers → ~1 day
- 10,000 workers?
- ≈ 2.8 hours

### Translate this into “processing power”
- Interviewers don’t want “CPU GHz” — they want throughput.
- Required throughput
- Total MB:
- 1,000,000,000 MB

- To finish in 24 hours:

- 1,000,000,000 MB / 86,400 seconds
- ≈ 11,574 MB/sec
- ≈ 11.5 GB/sec

- Your system must sustain ~11.5 GB/s read throughput

### Microservice capacity framing (VERY IMPORTANT)
- You say:
- “Instead of one service reading everything, we shard data and distribute work.”
- Example:
- 1,000 microservice instances
- Each handles 1 TB
- Each instance throughput:
- 11.5 MB/sec
- Very manageable.

### Bottlenecks to call out (interview gold)
- You MUST mention these:
- Disk throughput
- Network bandwidth
- Connection limits
- Hot partitions
- Retry amplification
- Backpressure

- ### Optimizations (shows design maturity)
- Mention at least 3:
- Batch reads (reduce I/O calls)
- Increase read size (5×1MB → 1×5MB)
- Caching hot data
- Async I/O
- Data locality (move compute closer to data)
- Compression (trade CPU for I/O)
