- now we want users to be able to login to our system , we will token based authentication, users will login , and we will send them one token , using this token they will be able to call our apis
- so everytime Gateway service has to ask Auth service about user if it is authenticated or not , so what can we do , instead we can cache the data required to validate the token
- now there is one problem , we are having the cache at gateway service and this service itself is a distributed servers, so lot of duplication and computation to update it , and plus if other service register happend it has notify Gateway service about it, may be through message queues
- so to improve it we can use global cahcing and store all the data at one place
