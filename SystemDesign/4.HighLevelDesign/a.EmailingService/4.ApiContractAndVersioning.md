- well we have many services Gateway services , then profile service now for creation of profile requires data which is in json format so you need to know about the api contract
- if there is any change in the service the other services using it will have to update the their api contract
- how do we do it for example we have gateway service and other service api contract needs to be updated all the time in gateway service

- now instead of doing that we can use service registry , here we are fanning out so instead let the service pull and make the update

- even more we can just create a contract registry

- while storing the users profile picture , we will just get the profile url , as image upload will happen on client side itself, lets in some drive service

- now if we want to store informaiton of user for their user preferences we will store it in preference store
