- well this is also quiet simple to store the contact everytime the user sends the email it comes to email store and this email store sends it queue , now we will have something called contact mapping service this service will subscribe to that quue in email email sent from user , to user will be added to contact and vice versa
- but what if it is a spam, then it better to send only processed email in the queue
- and for group we will give users an api to create the user group

- in case if we have to send the email external service like yahoo or anything else then we need SMTP server and to receive an email from other services we need IMAP server
