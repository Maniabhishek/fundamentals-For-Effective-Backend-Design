### Features
- create, storing, updating, reading documents (CRUD)
- sharing permissions (where users can read and edit through link)
- notification through mail
- version history (diff checker)
- spell checker (not so important)
- comment support (not so important)
- offline support

### with all the above features the most important thing about all is collaboration, where multiple users will be using the same document , which means we need to handle concurrent operations and data consistency, these two are the biggest problems
