### Observability In DS
- logging and monitoring(Number of I/O operations, Memory usage , Number of sales, Number of visitors) cloud watch one of the example
- Anomaly detection
- Root cause analysis


### Anomaly detection
- main reason: quick response to the problems
- this is mainly used to find some unusualy activity in your system or some anomaly in your system
- lets during the black friday sale, there is something unusual happens any spike in graph will result into anomaly
- it can also be used for video retention

### Root cause analysis
- now after anomaly has been detected , then what caused it
- lets say we have started using 3X memory , then what has caused it
- Two way we can find out the root cause analysis Manual and Automated
    - Manual
        - manually look in to the systems and build an incident report for example, when did the fault occur, what was the root cause, technique to find the root cause
        - one of the most famous technique 5
            - why did that happen (may be because it was consuming lot of memory)
            - why did that happen (amy be generating lot of pdf files), this can go deeper , and can get difficult answering all whys
