- important to have some idea on timeseries, graph, relational, noSQL
- another important thing is when choosing db we need to know what kind of application we are working on , what kind of data we are storing, what are we most comfortable with
- even more important look at the tradeoffs dbs gives you for example postgres: high consistency , high durablility, in case of better availability it doesnt have anything off the shelf , we beeter need to have a read replica to improve the availability
- another db cassandra which has high availability, it has cluster architecture , if one of the node goes down another node can pick it up, if we talk about its consistency then it is not very consistent requires extra effort, but better thing is that it has inbuilt fault tolerance capability
- another db called neo4j which is a graph database , better for graphs , but if you want to store the count of likes on any video then probably this is not the best db
- so the db is something you can call it a server where we store data in persistent manner, thats all you need to focus on , we should focus on how we read the db and how we store the db
