### Linearize consistency
- A read operation will result in the **MOST UP TO DATE** data
- everyone request the data gets the updated data every time
- lets say we have post every user requesting that post will get accurate comments, likes, etc.,

### Example
- lets say we have room with a single door for processing , everytime user comes enters through the door and process its request and leaves the room then next person can go in
- this way consistency is acheived
- all the request is processed in queue in some order one by one
- but what if a person goes in takes lot of time to process , then other person will also have to wait for his turn , this is called **head of line blocking**
- with this it will also increase the latency (high latency)
- low availability

### Benefits 
- highly consistent 

### Implementation
- single thread (everything processed by one computer)
- RAFT - you can also user RAFT protocol which maintains the order of reqeusts across the distributed system
