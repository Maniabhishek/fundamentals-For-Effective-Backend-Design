### Linearizable
- highly consistent
- lowest efficiency

### Eventual consitency
- lower consistency
- highly efficient

### causal consistency
- high level of consistency what we are doing here is , making sure the request with same id remain sequential, basically all the relevant read and write request are in order
- efficiency is also high much better than linearizable consistency

### Quorum Consistency
- efficiency and consistency is configurable (cost is high)
