### Consistency ?
- A measure of **how up to date** the data is inside a system
- lets say we have value of x = 20 stored in db
- now it gets updated with + 10 becomes 30
- again it gets updated with + 10 becomes 40
- now user reqeusts and the gets the value as 40 this means wer are getting latest value , we can call it strong consistency
- but if user had requested the data received data from 2nd update that is 30 , even when 3rd update has already been done then this is called as weak consistency

### Why is it so important
- Easier to understand
- user experience (lets say user likes a post and refereshes it and sees his like was registered and getting correct value , but in a case where users like was not registered immediately and takes time to update the count of likes then it might upset the users)
