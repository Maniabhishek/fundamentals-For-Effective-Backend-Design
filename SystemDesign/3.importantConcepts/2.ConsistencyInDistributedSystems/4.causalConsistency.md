- we can improve on consistency level, take the first request which is Read(1), key 2 is not relevant for us, id 1 is the customer and we only care about this right now lets say
- so first come read(1) , write(1,31), then read(1) output you are expecting, read(1) = 21, write(31), then read(1) =  31, this is what we want
- in case linearizability, we will see the first request will be blocker for all other requests
- for example final read(1) , is getting blocked by other requests which not even relevant to 1 key , there could be case that Read(2), write(2,17), might fail in that case also read(1) is getting blocked
- so what you want you want to extract this request with id here 1 all the request with id 1 , read(1), write(1,31), read(1) , you want to order these reqeusts sequentially , and same with id 2 requests
- this ordering of reqeuests sequentially is known as causal consistency
- if a request A related to the requests before the reqeust A , then  it has be processed before A request , causal consistency is about cause and effect
- so these order of requests will be processed on the same server , or same thread , there will be lock the respective key, there will be global lock on the key once executed lock will be released
- read(1), write(1,31), read(1) these are the operations for which it will execute sequentially , lets say read(1) comes lock this key in db , reads it then response is being sent, then comes write(1,31) locks the id 1 updates it to 31 lock is released after update, then read comes again locaks the key 1 and then reads the data
