### Read Uncommitted
- Single data entry, this is quiet simple data will be overridden whenever there is update operations

### Read Committed 
- you have local copy of changed values, basically while updating inside the transaction it only updates in local copy until commit goes through , meanwhile other operation will still read the old value as long as commit of updating data transaction is not done

### Repeatable Read (snapshot isolation)
- the point is, everytime i read same key in one transaction should get the same value again and again
- how it is implemented, by keeping verioning of unchanged values lets say we have 1,2,3,4 and write 3,4
- it is just 1 and 2 which are unchanged thus we will keep the versioning of these two values
- first we read 1 get value have versioning for this then 1 value was updated to 17 have versioning for this as well this way we can ensure to have same value for every transaction


### Serializable 
- Queued locks Read(1,2) , Read(2,3), Write(3), Read(1,4) we need to have some serialization in order to execute these operations in transaction, good thing if any transaction or operation which is not related to it can be executed concurrently
- for example Read(5,7) this is not at all related to Read(2,3), Read(1,2) or any of above transactions
