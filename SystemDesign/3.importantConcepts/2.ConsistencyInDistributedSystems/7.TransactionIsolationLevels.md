### Transaction Isolation Levels
- Data consistency is something , continuous streams of operations happening in your db
- whereas Transaction isolation , this is  about only one transaction , it is limited to the scope of data inside the transaction
- Lets say we have two transaction T1 and T2 (query with something knwon as BEGIN and COMMIT ) Begin and commit are an indication for the DB to register that there is tranaction happening on it, commit is like saving the data which is in transaction , which makes it durable one of the properties of ACID
- Lets say T1 and T2 are happening in parallel or concurrently , Read 2 if it tries to read something uncommited , in this case it will allow to read , (even uncommited data can be read by concurrent transaction) 1. single copy of the data 2.read is from the latest copy of the data
- there can also be ghost situation in this in these two transaction when we are reading from key 1 and this key is getting updated in tranaction 1 , write operation in transaction T2 gets executed first and update key 1 to 50 from 14 and then T1 reads key 1 and sees the latest uncommited data which is 50 but somehow T2 tranaction gets failed at last and rolls back (ACID Atomicity either all or nothing) Key 1 will have 14 value back and read in T1  has returned 50 which we will never now how did we get that value , because there will no history on db as well
