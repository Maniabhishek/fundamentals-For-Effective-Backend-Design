### Transaction Isolation Levels (Read uncommitted )
- Data consistency is something , continuous streams of operations happening in your db
- whereas Transaction isolation , this is  about only one transaction , it is limited to the scope of data inside the transaction
- Lets say we have two transaction T1 and T2 (query with something knwon as BEGIN and COMMIT ) Begin and commit are an indication for the DB to register that there is tranaction happening on it, commit is like saving the data which is in transaction , which makes it durable one of the properties of ACID
- Lets say T1 and T2 are happening in parallel or concurrently , Read 2 if it tries to read something uncommited , in this case it will allow to read , (even uncommited data can be read by concurrent transaction) 1. single copy of the data 2.read is from the latest copy of the data
- there can also be ghost situation in this in these two transaction when we are reading from key 1 and this key is getting updated in tranaction 1 , write operation in transaction T2 gets executed first and update key 1 to 50 from 14 and then T1 reads key 1 and sees the latest uncommited data which is 50 but somehow T2 tranaction gets failed at last and rolls back (ACID Atomicity either all or nothing) Key 1 will have 14 value back and read in T1  has returned 50 which we will never now how did we get that value , because there will no history on db as well

- to solve the above problem there is another transaction level called as **Read Committed**
- now what happens , lets say from T1 Read 2 and Write 2 takes place and it is currently uncommited
- now T1 Read 1 happens what will we get we get 14 and write 1 takes place and read 2 will happen what will we get , we will get 17 why because write 2 has not been committed yet
- so here it wont create the copy of the db but for key it will update at the transaction level(every transaction will have copy of the data) and read 2 in T2 will happen from original table and hence gets 17 once T1 is commited only then we get updated value
- with this we will have **higher Isolation level** (ACID)
- this is necessary in case of booking application like movie ticket booking , where we need higher level of isolation
- having higher level of isolation is also expensive and increases latency
- but when it is not necessary (and Read uncommited works efficiently) in case getting the views on video even if T1 transaction fails after updating and some other transaction read the uncommited data we may get wrong data as T1 transaction failed and it had rolled back the data , with application for views and all it is not so much important and critical for business
