- above problem is not ok for some application but perfectly finr for some other type of application
- for example mailing application , sender send a meesage to someone , it goes to outbox but it doesnt shows in sentbox yet , since it is outbox it will eventually be sent and then it will be sent to sentbox
- even if user refreshes and doesnt sees the message in sentbox its not a problem as it is in outbox once sent it will be there , so immediate consistency is not so important in this case , it will have eventual consistency
