- consistency where it ensures data in db is always up to date
- every write updates the data properly and on every read data is accurate
- different systems where incorrect or dirty data is not forgiveable like system which gives you transactions, bank Accounts, file manager

- whereas availability when we request some data from server , and server says ok i can give you data in 3 sec , but in case it didnt return you data in that time this means your system was unavailable for that period of time
- so if you can get the data back from server in reasonable amount of time then system is available and if you dont get the data back then that is known as system is unavailable

### Tradeoffs b/w consistency and availabilty
- a user requests data of a film start tom cruise , and gets the profile of tom cruise
- now what happens if at the same time tome cruise also tries to update the data , request updates the db and then updates the cache , but the user who requested, get the data from cache before it was updated then this is inconsistent data
- same thing can be thought when we have multiple server and multiple dbs, for example one server and db is india and another in usa, now user in india requests the data of tom cruz profile from india server and gets the data and at the same time tom updates his profile in USA server , this way consistency is compromised
- suppose which this update in USA server was going on and somehow usa server and db crashes, then users in india will still be getting services from server, this means system is available even us server is down , but we dont have tom cruze's latest profile data, so consistency is compromised but we have better availability
- but if we want to have better consistency then in that case we will keep one source of truth (single source of truths or few source of truths) , then tom cruzes update will always come here and you will always get the consistent data , but in this case you have lost the avilability(you request may fails if system is down) and consistency is achieved
- this is the tradeoffs we can have between consistency and availabilty
