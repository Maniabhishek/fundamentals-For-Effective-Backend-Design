### Throughput vs Latency
- latency: amount of time it takes get the response from the server from the time of request made is called latency
- thorughput: lets say your application can handle 20 instruction/sec at any given time lets say 8 instruction are on wait for saving data to db , another 4 lets say are doing garbage collection , and 8 are actually doing application work
- so the throughput of the your application will (8/20)*100 = 40%
