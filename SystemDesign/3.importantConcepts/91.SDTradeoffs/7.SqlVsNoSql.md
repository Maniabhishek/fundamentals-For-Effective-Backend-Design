### NoSQL Vs SQL
### SQL:
- High Consistency (usually)
- Primary Replica architecutre
- Assigned Primary (Single source of truth writes)
- No Inbuilt Sharding 
- ACID support

### NoSQL:
- Relaxed consistency
- cluster architecture
- Leader Election , Consensus Algorithm (consensus , equality before selecting which node to write (coming to some value of consent))
- In-build sharding , lets say 0-20 request goes to one of the node and then 20-40 goes to another , since it has cluster architecture
- No - ACID support
