### Push/Pull Architecture
- lets understand it with an example, suppose a very famous person who make a post on their account , who have millions of followers
- now this post has to reach all the followers , how are we going to send it
- suppose if we send it in one go , we will just load the server with heavy compute , server can also crash
- so what we can do instead of sending everything at once we will follow certain pattern
- lets the famous person has 10 millions of followers , out of these not all of them would want the posts immediately
- some are just following but might not be interested so much in the post of famous guy, some might be passive followers , but some could be fans who wants immediate notification then moment he makes a post
- so for the fans what we can do is that , we will allow notification service to push all the notification to those fans , but better approach could be , if we send it in batches , to lower the load , or have some delay after every batch, this way of updating or send the notification is called push architecutre
- now what about the passive users and other users who are not fan , so for those users we will let them query our service , which means the moment they open up their account we will show them this post when they query about it ,and then they will see it , this is pull method
- now there will be group of user who are not so much active but , we still have to show, then they will see it through recommendation engine (they will query recommendation engine) where they will find the famous guy post
- there is another hybrid model as we can in the above image , so we have notification service, and message queue, lets say notification service will pushes the events to message queue at the rate of 3 events per sec and ingestion rate is 30 events/sec, to the priority users we will push these events , and some of users will pull the events from message queue, with this we have decoupled the notification service from distribution

### advatanges and disadvantages 
- Pull: Lesser peak loads on the system (but every user starts pulling at the same time, it can heavily increase the load on system)
- Pull: Client decides what they want to see
- Pull: you need to store the data for more time , (lets say 24 hr or 48 hr, you can understand it with famous guy posting a image, some of their followers might be late opening the app, so we need to keep it it memory for some more time)
- Push: Low latency (immediately sent to users) , memory is lesser (in long term) may be higher in short time
