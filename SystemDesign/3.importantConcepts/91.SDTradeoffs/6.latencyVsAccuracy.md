- latency: amount of time it takes to complete a request is latency
- lets say we made a request to a server and it has data in the cache , from the cache it can return the response in 1 ms but with db it will take 10ms , lets say in cache one key has value of 30 and in db value is 31 , in this case to improve the latency we have comromised with accuracy , we are calling accuracy instead of consistency
- why accuracy , lets understand it with an example , lets say we have an application which have likes on post , now everytime likes reqeust comes it will just send to the queue for updating in db , to get the count of the likes we will get the data from cache which could be older this data might not be same as data in db, now lets say we have some sort of calcluation to find likes (earlier like)*(latest views)/(older view in cache) so this formula is just the ratio on the number of view and likes , so this is inaccurate data but latency is must better here
- these inaccuracy is fine for some applicaiton but may not be fine for some other application like banking apps
- (Stream vs Batch) similarly for google maps , lets say there is one secion of road where you found vehicles going at different speed than usual days , we will not take all the vehicles but few percentage of vehicle request and update that section of road as broken , now this might not be accurate , it could be inaccurate data
