### What is tradeoffs in SD?
- well if you want to create a feature of uploading an image to to your app, you want users to be able to upload images, and while uploading a users internet goes down , when internet is back up then user should be able to resume uploading from the same point
- so function requirement is uploading pictures , here non functional requirement is recover from failure to upload
- another non functional requirement is safe and persistent , means users data should be safe, should not destroyed by any disaster, so we need to keep the data at multiple place, but another non functional requirement is violated which is cost
- for viewing images , we need cache to improve response time , lets say we keep only few copies of data in db rest are already in cache this way we can save some db space , these are the basic tradeoffs
