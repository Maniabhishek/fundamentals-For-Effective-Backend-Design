- lets say we have apis in our application which has latency 1000ms and we want to improve this
- to improve it we started using redis to cache some of the data , for example profile data of few user we have been querying db to get the user everytime
- to improve it we started storing users profile in to cache for accessing it quickly
- now using cache have increased the costing to the company
- we will do some tradeoffs, instead of storing all the profiles we will just store hot data , and can better write policy and use replacement policies to better manage the memories
