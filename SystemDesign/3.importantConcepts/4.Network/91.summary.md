- WebRTC uses peer-to-peer communication . HTTP 2.0, HTTP-DASH and QUIC (HTTP 3.0) used client-server communication
- HTTP 3.0 also known as QUIC uses UDP for data transfer. WebRTC, used for video streaming also uses UDP (QUIC and HTTP/3 are used for real-time applications like video conferencing, gaming, and live streaming, as well as mobile applications, IoT devices, connected vehicles, and eCommerce platforms)
- gRPC uses HTTP 2.0. HTTP 2.0 breaks the data packets into streams to prevent head of line blocking. It is known as multiplexing
