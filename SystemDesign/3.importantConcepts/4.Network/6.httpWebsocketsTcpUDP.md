-  as in the image above we can see we need to see how reqeusts are being send from router to server
-  most common protocol is HTTP while communicating to server (most common for client to server)
-  can server send the request to the client , no even if it does and somehow findout the router ip address , router will not know where to redirect this request, then you need NAT here and client has to behave like a server
-  this becomes an issue when you want to send a message to client , hence http is not ideal for this case
-  hence Websockets is used for peer to peer communication
-  websocket is layer 7 protocol , application layer protocol, it gives functionality for peer to peer connection , both sender and receiver can send and receive the request
-  now it is no more request but it is the messages
    -  chat application requires presence , contact list management, instant messaging , these all can be provided by XMPP(Extensible Messaging and presence protocol) , which is an open XML technology for real time communication, which powers a wide range of application including instant messaging, presence and collaboration
- Websockets and HTTP both uses TCP internally 

### TCP
- well we saw , basic idea of protocol is to have language, address (routing) , behavioral(whether communication is completed or not)
- for example A sends a packet to B and B acknowledges it and send ack(1) then A send another packet 2 after geting the ack from B for 1 so TCP ensure the ordering of the packets
- it is very important in case of banking application what if + 10 then -20 comes to update the balance then any miss ordering can cause an issue
