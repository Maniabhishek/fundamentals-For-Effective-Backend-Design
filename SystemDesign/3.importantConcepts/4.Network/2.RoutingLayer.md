### Routing Layer
- after physical layer next important thing is routing layer
- well you dont really need to route messages , lets say you broadcast a message and someone eavesdrop it that message was received, for example if you shout in a room, there is another person he will hear you , you didnt really route it , but what if you want to route it to only one person , in that case it is very useful
- lets understand with postbox example, A wants to send a message to B via post office , A writes message and wrap it inside an envelope with senders address receivers address now this address is being decoded by post office in order to deliver this message to correct address
- similarly in real world who decodes the address it is the router which decodes the address and send the message to correct receiver
- now what is this address , this is hardware address, you need identity and location, in computer network, you broadcast your ip address to your local routers, these router will broadcast the messages further, the sender when send they send it first to the router they know whom to send the messages next
