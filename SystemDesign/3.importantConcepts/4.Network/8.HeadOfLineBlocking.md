- there is one common problem with HTTP, A wants to send request 1 to B , B send back response, again request 2 being sends to B from A, now all these are being send one by one in order
- the problem here is there might be some other request that might be waiting for these request which were sent before to complete , this is helpful, when these request are somehow related and needs to be ordered
- lets take few request 1,2,3,4,5 [1,2] are on the same bank account and [3,4,5] are on the same bank account, now what we want is to give the ordering of these two requests [3,4,5] and [1,2] seperately
- lets say request ordering is now 1,3,2,4 and  then 5 request 2 somehow got failed , 4 and 5 still should be processed , this was not possible until HTTP 2.0 , HTTP2.0 provides the capability to do this called multiplexing
- it does so by break the messages in to streams, one message part of streams [1,2] part of stream id [1,1]  and [3,4,5] are part of stream id [2,2,2] , if you get the message of stream id 1, then this stream of messages from id 1 will be blocked as long as 2 is not taken care of, but 4 and 5 can go through as this is from different streams
- internally http uses TCP , and tcp requires acknowledgement
