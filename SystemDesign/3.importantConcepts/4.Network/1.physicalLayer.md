- two computer how do they communicate , first thing , how do a cmputer exactly read the messages
- lets understand with an example two person A and B wants to communicate with the help of sun ray
- A uses mirror to reflect the sunlight to the user B every B sees reflection it means 1, if not reflecting and moves mirror towards sun then it means 0
- now how will user B read the message , if A relected light towards him once mean 1 and when stops sending , then B will start assuming 000000, but how many 0
- so B need to know the start and the end of the message  that is known as delimeter
- so we need start and end delimiter
- similarly in computer , when two computers communicate to each other they send the message between the start and end delimeter
