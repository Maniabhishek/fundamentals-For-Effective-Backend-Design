- two computer how do they communicate , first thing , how do a cmputer exactly read the messages
- lets understand with an example two person A and B wants to communicate with the help of sun ray
- A uses mirror to reflect the sunlight to the user B every B sees reflection it means 1, if not reflecting and moves mirror towards sun then it means 0
- now how will user B read the message , if A relected light towards him once mean 1 and when stops sending , then B will start assuming 000000, but how many 0
- so B need to know the start and the end of the message  that is known as delimeter
- so we need start and end delimiter
- similarly in computer , when two computers communicate to each other they send the message between the start and end delimeter


- The Physical Layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for physically transmitting raw bits (0s and 1s) over a communication medium.

### Key responsibilities:

1. Bit transmission
  - Sends and receives raw bits
  - No understanding of frames, packets, or addresses
2. Signaling
  - How 0s and 1s are represented
  - Electrical signals (voltage levels)
  - Optical signals (light pulses)
  - Radio signals (wireless)
3. Data rate (Bit rate)
  - Speed of transmission (bps, Mbps, Gbps)
4. Transmission mode
  - Simplex (one-way)
  - Half-duplex (both ways, not simultaneously)
  - Full-duplex (both ways simultaneously)
5. Physical topology
  - Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh
6. Medium & connectors
  - Cables, connectors, pin layouts
