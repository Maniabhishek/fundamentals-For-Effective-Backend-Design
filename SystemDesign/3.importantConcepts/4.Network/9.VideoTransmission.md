### Protocols for video transmission
- video cannot be sent back in single response , it has to be broken in to packets, so thats one problem
- the other thing is if you send a request of the first packet then you ask for next packet and so on and so forth. this is possible of course with HTTP also, but its a terrible waste of resources. So statelessness doesnt look like a good idea this is one thing
- The other thing is when you're sending packets what happens if you dont get a response , so if this is live streaming data, like we said this is real time data in which case UDP seems like the best fit and not TCP
- but there can be situation when you are requesting video of a movie data, where er dont want to miss any part of film (it could be one important part of movie) , in such situation TCP video transmission makes send where order and devlivery guarntees
- lets first see TCP video protocol , most famous one is **HTTP - DASH** (dynamic adaptive streaming over http) since this is also build over tcp , it gurantees delivery and ordering
- basic idea is that you send a signal from your client to the server (which is serving video) based on the data you can handle, so if your client device has a 720p max resolution thers no point for the google server to actually send you really high resolution 4k video , that will be waste of netwrok bandwidth and processing and everything else. So instead its going to look at this request at connection establishment and then say 720 is the max you can handle let me send that.
- The other thing is connection maintenance again control signals are sent saying that , my network is slow , only able to receive 360p of fata in one second so the user for a good user experience view in 360p its contnuous viewing vs buffering in 720p
- Very similar protocol used in mac devices **HLS** both of these have control signals, which tell you the quality of the connection and what would be the adaptive bitrate to send the the video both are written over TCP

### Conference Video Protocol
- lets get rid of google being sending video , lets the two client communicate each other directly,1 and 2 should communicate directly
    - for this 1 needs to find the location of 2
    - Need to do network address translation
-  protocol to be used here is **WebRTC**
- initially you dont know where 2 exist you can do so using google , google will autheticate you and 2 also wants to join , and authenticate both
- then gives them the information to connect to browser to browser
- how is media transfer happening , you can **TURN** , **STUN** servers, over the internet backbone
- Media server in case when you want to do some sort of broadcasting , lets say you want to broadcast to 100 of users , then 3rd user come joins you you need to create 2 new connection, it becomes order square problem,  to avoid it you can just use media server
- WebRTC built over UDP
