- well now in the first two layer we saw messages can be read and can be routed , but how to determine if conversation is completed, there is something called conversation settings
- How frequently A can send message to B can B receive from A, or can B send directly to A , does B have capability to talk to A
- we can we define the frequency and direction of the messages
- lets say A have 25 mb of data to be sent to B , it sent 5 mb first rest 20 mb how would B know still there data left to be recieved
- delimeter are only concerned with only one message , a conversation is much longer, thats why we need to use the same principal here as well
- the way conversation is going to go ahead is determined by behavioral layer
- If we map to OSI model
- then Physical Layer then routing layer maps to data link layer, network layer, transport layer then behavioral layer which maps to session layer
- there are other 2 presentation and Apllication , this is more on code not conceptual
