- previously we saw how we were connecting to any server by typing the url
- now lets say i am requesting to google server everytime it goes to server and fetches it , there can be many users requesting the same page and if all the request comes to server load increases significantly and will eventually slow down , what google can do here they can these page cached , at google server level but still it has to make network request which eats up the n/w bandwidth, now another solution that we can store those pages at users local storage, but what if tomorrow google update the page users might be seeing stale page
- so there is perfect solution for this to have these page stored at CDN , this is kind of cache , CDN is globally distributed server , akamai one of the company provides CDN

- now when google send the response to user it comes to users , now how does the router understands which user requested this information
- well when user send the information, it also sends the routing information in request itself, this way it can know
- what is the network protocol used in this sending the routing information , it is NAT (network address translation)
- the idea is you have identifier for a device inside the network, instead of mac address , we can use the virtual ip address 22.31.2.2 this may be not unique but this is unique within the network, another way is to directly sending to mac address from router but this could have the security concern, what if someone updat the mapping of mac address in router
