- previously we saw how we were connecting to any server by typing the url
- now lets say i am requesting to google server everytime it goes to server and fetches it , there can be many users requesting the same page and if all the request comes to server load increases significantly and will eventually slow down , what google can do here they can these page cached , at google server level but still it has to make network request which eats up the n/w bandwidth, now another solution that we can store those pages at users local storage, but what if tomorrow google update the page users might be seeing stale page
- so there is perfect solution for this to have these page stored at CDN , this is kind of cache , CDN is globally distributed server , akamai one of the company provides CDN
