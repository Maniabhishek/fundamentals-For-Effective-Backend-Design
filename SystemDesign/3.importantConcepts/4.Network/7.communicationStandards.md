- when the request goes to any server , lets say google server in this case (when searched for google.com) now google server can further have different microservices
- suppose we have one profile microservices and all other service could require profile services , they need to know how a profile is defined , the first thing is language , so how is the object of id is defined {id: 123, name:"abc", age: 20}, a bunch of these definition provides you the language to query this service, for example we can query, give me all the ids where age is greater than 10
- services are able to query to each other , capable to response to each other what protocol should you use for language for definition for a contract basis one of the popular protocol used is **THRIFT** developed by facebook
- the idea is , you might be running different services with different languages one service in python , another in go, another js, these services need to read the same object in different languages, what you do you dont define this object in every single language, instead you have intermediate language, which defines these object in almost as pseudocode, for example , id which is string can become text , name become text age become int, basically the type of these fields in object
- once you defined the language , only question is how will you query these microservices
- most common technique is **REST** , very common protocol, used over HTTP, you have cacheable responses (not necessary , on server side not necessary)
- REST is stateless, for example profile?id=20, profile?id=23 (these are state less) , profile?id=+20 and give me 43 (this is not stateless , and it doesnt happen), server will never store any state related to your query that make every requests stateless
- Rest APIs are stateless because , rather than relying on the server remembering previous requests , REST applications requires each request to contain all the information necessary for the server to understand it
- there is another protocol which is GraphQL, in case of REST when you are querying for profile from id 1 to 10 , it may send you the whole object of user 1 to 10 , but what if you are only interested in name and age , this can be done using graphql, this saves bandwidth, also removes security concerns about critical data
- how is reqeust actually sent to other services , common protocol is GRPC written over HTTP 2.0
