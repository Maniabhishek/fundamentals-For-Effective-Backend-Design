### Write through policy
- we have {1:20, 2:30} in our cache , now update comes to cache for key 1, it removes the key 1 from cache updates db {1:40}
- now read reqeust comes for key 1 , it doesnt find the key in cache fetches it from db and updates the caches on it way back to client
- but there is an issue in a situation when update comes for key 1 it tries updating db deletes cache and tries updating this value in db , but at the same time read request comes for key 1 sees the cache doesnt find any value then tries to fetch the data from db now previous update is still in progres , lets say this read request is served first and get the old value , this is possible if there is no ordering or request , but if there is ordering we are writing first and take a lock on this key then this is fine or we read uncommitted data this is isolation level where we will read uncommitted data
