### Replacement Policies
- suppose we have two keys in cache and that is maximum we can have in cache , now there comes another key which needs to be stored in cache , we dont have memory to store anymore , to do we need to replace any key with the new one
- to do so we have few replacement policies mentioned below

### Least recently used
- the key which was used long back will be replaced with the new key
- [{1:20, lu:20},{2:30, lu:30}] now new key {3:40, lu: 40}, key 1 was last used at timestamp 20 , hence this key will replace with key 3

### Least Frequently Used
- they key that has been used least will be replace with the new key
- [{1:20, f:20},{2:30, f:30}] f is the frequency of each key, now new key {3:40} comes this has to be inserted in cache we need to remove one of the key, key 1  with frequency 20 will be removed and replaced by {3:40, f:1}

- now as we see constant cache misses and repeatedly update and eviction in caches called as thrashing

- for any good performing caches , it needs to have high hit ratio and low miss ratio
