### Write around policy
- in this policy any write or update request comes first it is directly updated in to the database, no changes are made in caches
- now we have different data in cache and db for any given key which was updated
- now how is cache going to get update , so it will be update once this updated key is being kicked out of cache
- we can have something like TTL of keys which will keep evicting these keys
- having this kind policy ensures **persistence** as data is always stored in db
- it will have eventual consistency when caches kicks out the any keys
- efficiency is good, there is no cache contention , no hammering on cache on every write/update/delete
