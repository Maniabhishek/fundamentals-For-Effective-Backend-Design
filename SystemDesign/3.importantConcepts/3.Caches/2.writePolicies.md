### write policies
- write policies are different that replacement policies , in case replacement policies new data is being brought from db and cache is full then we need to decide which data will be evicted to replace it with new data
- in case of write policy we actually write a new data it can write , update delete

### Write back policy
- when we have some data in cache lets {1: 20, 2: 30} now if there is any update we update the cache , db will still have old value, there is any read operations from cache since it is consistent hence read will return the latest data
- now what if cache server crashes we will loose all the data and again if we request key 1 we will get the stale data from db, and same will be loaded to cache
- now to improve this we need to use write back policy
- in the write back policy , it has eventual consistency with db , data from cache will be periodically updated to db
- {1:20, 2:30, 3: 40} (values in cache) now we get the update reqeust for 1 {1:50} it will update the cache , now how and when will this data get persisted in db
- one of the approach is using timestamp based update lets for key 1 {1:20 , ttl: 50} lets say if current timestamp goes beyond 50 , then this value will be updated in db now db and cache will have same data which is why this is eventual consistent
- we can also keep db consistent based on number of updates for a particular key lets say {1:20, update: 0} updates to -> {1:30, update: 1} ....{1:90, update: 5} once update is 5 we can now update this value in db , this is event based
- we can also update data at the time of eviction (freshness of data) {1: 20, 2: 30} lets say a new key is to be inserted 3:50 and suppose our cache is full and one key need to be removed lets say we are removing key 1 then on removal of this key we will also update this key in db
