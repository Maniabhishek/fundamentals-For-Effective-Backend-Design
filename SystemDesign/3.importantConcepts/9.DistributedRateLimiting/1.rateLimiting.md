- to avoid the cascading failiures we can do a few things to avoid it:
    - Messaging protocol (gRPC built on HTTP 2.0, no head on line blocking) does multiplexing
    - reduce the size of message (kryo)
    - client connection (create -> read/parse request -> close ) do not close the connection immediately
    - pull/ push hybrid (like celebrity problem when a celebrity make some post instead of sending this post to each of the user , let the user pull it)
    - gracefull degradation (for example if we have new year just started , and everyone wants to send happy new year message , then read receipts is something not so important , message whether it is being sent or not is very important)
