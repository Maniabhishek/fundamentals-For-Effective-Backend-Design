- one problem with our current algorithm is , when server acquires lock , it is completely tied with the server identity
- so each server has to make a unique lock request. It is not possible for another server see that their request is going to get rejected (becasue the logline was booked or locked by another server ) and just to speed the algorithm up, agree on the previous value
- Also, the system is hard to debug in case you have errors across generations of elections.

### Without timestamps → chaos
- If Paxos didn’t use timestamps:
    - Two proposers could convince different subsets of DB servers to accept different values.
    - There’d be no way to reconcile which value is the “right” one.
    - That would break consensus (safety violation).


### Lets imporve the algorithm 
- as of now another servers dont know that there request is going to get rejected

### Step to improve using timestamp and how it works
- Step 1: Proposal with timestamp
    - Each app server (proposer) generates a proposal with a unique timestamp (like T=101).
    - This timestamp is usually (local counter, server ID) so no two proposers clash.
- Step 2: Asking DB servers (Prepare phase)
    - The app server with T=101 asks all DB servers: “Can I write my value?”
    - Each DB server checks:
        - If it hasn’t promised anything higher, it says “Okay, I promise not to accept anything lower than 101.”
        - If it has already promised something higher (say T=105), it rejects
- Step 3: Writing to DBs (Accept phase)
    - If enough DB servers promised, the app server sends: “Write my value at timestamp 101.”
    - Each DB server checks:
    - If it hasn’t seen a higher timestamp, it accepts and stores (value, 101).
    - If it has already promised something higher (like 105), it rejects the request.
 
- In short:
    - Timestamps are the tie-breaker and ordering mechanism in Paxos.
    - They ensure that:
        - Older proposals don’t override newer ones (safety).
        - Failed proposals can be retried with a higher number (liveness).
        - All DBs converge on a single consistent value.

### Example
- Step 1: Server A starts with proposal timestamp T=5
    - 👉 Prepare Phase
        - Server A sends: Prepare(5) to all DBs.
        - 👉 DB responses
            - DB1: “OK, I promise not to accept < 5.”
            - DB2: “OK, I promise not to accept < 5.”
            - DB3: “OK, I promise not to accept < 5.”
            - ✅ Server A has majority (2 of 3). It can proceed.
    - 👉 Accept Phase
        - Server A sends: Accept(5, X)
        - All DBs accept and store (X, 5).
- Step 2: Server B starts later with proposal timestamp T=8
    - 👉 Prepare Phase
        - Server B sends: Prepare(8) to all DBs.
        - 👉 DB responses
            - Each DB compares 8 with its highest promised number (which was 5).
            - DB1: “OK, I promise not to accept < 8. Last accepted was (X,5).”
            - DB2: “OK, I promise not to accept < 8. Last accepted was (X,5).”
            - DB3: “OK, I promise not to accept < 8. Last accepted was (X,5).”
            - ✅ Server B now learns: the DBs already accepted (X,5).
- So, Paxos rule: proposer must carry forward the already accepted value.
    - 👉 Accept Phase
    - Server B sends: Accept(8, X) (not Y, must preserve X).
    - DBs accept (X,8) and update their record.

- Step 3: What if Server A tries again with T=5?
    - 👉 Prepare(5)
    - DBs check their highest promised timestamp (which is 8 now).
    - DB1: “Reject. I already promised ≥ 8.”
    - DB2: “Reject. I already promised ≥ 8.”
    - DB3: “Reject. I already promised ≥ 8.”
    - ❌ So Server A cannot proceed — it’s too old.
