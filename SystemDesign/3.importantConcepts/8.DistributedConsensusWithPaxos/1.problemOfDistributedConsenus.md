### Distributed Consensus Algorithm - paxos
- series of repeatable steps to reach a consensus , basically more than half of your node agree on a particular value
- distribbuted which means, a bunch of components which can individually fail and connect with each other using something like messages, the messages themselves may be dropped in between. So that's a distributed part of this
- now as we said , majority number of nodes should agree on a particular value , which is determind by an algorithm called paxos
- paxos is being used by apace zookeeper, used to distributed locking (use case was locking)
- google has its own google chubby, uses paxos
- basically locking is required , when you are going to write something on log line and multiple servers are going to be writing to multiple logs at the same time how do they reach consensus that the logs are going to be in particular order
- suppose there are 3 servers and 3 dbs to write to
