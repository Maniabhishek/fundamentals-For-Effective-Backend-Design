### Verification
- the first aspect in security is verification
- to verify whether the reqeust is coming from human being or not
- to do so we can use captcha
- SSL/TLS  -> Security algorithms
- Encryption Algorithms -> ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), RSA (Rivest shamir adleman)

### Authenication 
- Authenication where we check whether the user has correct credentials to login to our system, if so then server will give them the signed token
- using which they can access the apis which are permissible using that token
- there is something called private key , using which we generate the token and there is also something called public key
- if there is a singed token , we can use this public key to decrypt this token( unsigned token)
