### Verification
- the first aspect in security is verification
- to verify whether the reqeust is coming from human being or not
- to do so we can use captcha
- SSL/TLS  -> Security algorithms
- Encryption Algorithms -> ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), RSA (Rivest shamir adleman)

### Authenication using token
- Authenication where we check whether the user has correct credentials to login to our system, if so then server will give them the signed token
- using which they can access the apis which are permissible using that token
- there is something called private key , using which we generate the token and there is also something called public key
- if there is a singed token , we can use this public key to decrypt this token( unsigned token)


### Authentication using SSO
- where users are being authenticated using external service like google , apple , these services will authenticate the user and send server a token using which you can send the same one to user ,  and server will decrypt it using public key provided by these external services
- similarly OAuth can be used for authentication in this case as well some other service will be authenticating the user

 ### Authorization (Access control)
 - ACLs(access control lists ) role based(like admin , viewer), Group Based, Object Based
 - Rule Engine
 - Secret keys
 - Protection:
    - Hackers : DDOs WAF
    - Employees: Rule Engine (Restrict resource access)
    - Malicious code
  
### How Videos are protected inside CDN's
- simple token based , every time request is made verify the token , strong auth, simplicity, slow
- Domain restriction
- server side auth
