### Data replication 
- keeping multiple copies of data
- everytime data comes it will replicated to copy of db
- write will be performed to primary db
- and read can be performed from both the db

### Advantage
- falut tolerance (if primary db goes down copy of the db can become primary)
- Improved read speeds
- simple

### Disadvantage
- consistency (one db where we are writing , copy of the db might have stale data for some time)
- write speed will be slower as it will also write in the copy of db
