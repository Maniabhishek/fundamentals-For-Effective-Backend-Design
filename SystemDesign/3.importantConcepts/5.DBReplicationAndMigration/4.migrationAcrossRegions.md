- DB-Copy
    - Db-copy to new DB (few hours)
    - DB-copy with timestamps > x
    - Add and insert and update trigger to old - db
    - migrate all the missing records from old to new , timestamps > Y and timestamp < Z


- above were the steps we did for migration , now we are moving entire db from one cloud service provider to another
- we can still do 1 2, 4 steps what about the step 3 , any update coming to old db how are we going to take care of that, so step 3 is the complex part here

- for migration from one db to another (could be region or simply new db, in this case we are switching to new cloud provider)
