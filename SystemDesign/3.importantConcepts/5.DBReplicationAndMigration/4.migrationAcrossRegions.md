- DB-Copy
    - Db-copy to new DB (few hours)
    - DB-copy with timestamps > x
    - Add and insert and update trigger to old - db
    - migrate all the missing records from old to new , timestamps > Y and timestamp < Z


- above were the steps we did for migration , now we are moving entire db from one cloud service provider to another
- we can still do 1 2, 4 steps what about the step 3 , any update coming to old db how are we going to take care of that, so step 3 is the complex part here

- for migration from one db to another (could be region or simply new db, in this case we are switching to new cloud provider) steps we saw before are
      -  create a view behaving like the old table
      -  rename the view to old table , and rename the old table to obsolete
      -  restart servers with new code pointing to new table
      -  drop the view
      -  manual or automated validation of data

- above step , step 1 how are we going to create view which is across solutions
- step 2 as long as we can do step 1 we can do the step 2
- step is also not tough , requires code changes
- drop the view , should not be an issue
- step 4 , ofcourse will not be issue

- now we have two issues, one is how will we create the view , and even before how are the updates insert going to be handled
