- A WebSocket connection provides persistent, full-duplex communication between a client and server over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time, bidirectional data exchange without the constant overhead of new HTTP requests. The connection starts with an HTTP "Upgrade" request from the client, which the server responds to with a "101 Switching Protocols" status, establishing the WebSocket link. Messages can then be sent in any direction at any time until either the client or server explicitly closes the connection.  
### How it Works
1. Handshake: The client initiates the process by sending a standard HTTP GET request with specific headers, including "Connection: Upgrade" and "Upgrade: websocket". 
2. Server Response: If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with an HTTP 101 Switching Protocols status code, acknowledging the request to switch the communication protocol. 
3. Persistent Connection: The connection remains open indefinitely, allowing both the client and the server to send messages to each other at any time. 
4. Bidirectional Communication: Data can flow in both directions simultaneously, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time updates, such as live chat, financial data feeds, or online gaming. 
5. Connection Closure: Either the client or the server can close the connection by sending a specific message or through an interruption.
