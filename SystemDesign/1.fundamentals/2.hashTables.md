### What is a Hash Table?
- A hash table (also called hash map) is a data structure that stores keyâ€“value pairs for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions (usually O(1) time on average).
- It uses a hash function to map a key (like "username") to an index in an array (bucket list), where the value is stored.

### How It Works
- Take a key â†’ "Alice".
- Run it through a hash function (e.g., convert to number).
- hash("Alice") = 12345
- Use modulo to fit into table size:
- index = hash("Alice") % table_size
- Suppose table size = 10 â†’ index = 5.

- Store the value (say, "password123") at index 5.
- Later, when you search "Alice", the hash function will send you directly to index 5. ðŸš€

### Why Hash Tables Are Powerful
- Fast: Lookup, insert, delete in O(1) average case.
- Flexible: Any type of key (string, number, etc.), as long as it can be hashed.
- Thatâ€™s why languages use them for dictionaries/maps:

### The Problem â†’ Collisions
- Sometimes two keys hash to the same index. Example:
- hash("Alice") % 10 = 5
- hash("Bob")   % 10 = 5
- Both go to index 5 â†’ collision.

### Collision Handling Methods
- Chaining
    - Each bucket stores a linked list (or array) of values.
    - Both "Alice" and "Bob" sit at index 5, but in a list.
- Lookup may take longer (O(n) in worst case).
- Open Addressing
    - If the spot is full, find another empty spot in the table.

Methods: linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing.

### Example (with Chaining)
- Table size = 5
- Insert("Alice", 25) â†’ index 0
- Insert("Bob", 30)   â†’ index 0  (collision â†’ chain at index 0)
- Insert("Eve", 35)   â†’ index 3

```
Hash table:
0 â†’ [ ("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30) ]
1 â†’ [ ]
2 â†’ [ ]
3 â†’ [ ("Eve", 35) ]
4 â†’ [ ]
Lookup "Bob" â†’ Hash â†’ index 0 â†’ search chain â†’ found! âœ…
```
### Time Complexity
- Average case: O(1) for lookup, insert, delete.
- Worst case (lots of collisions): O(n).

- But with a good hash function and resizing when load factor is high, average stays very close to O(1).
