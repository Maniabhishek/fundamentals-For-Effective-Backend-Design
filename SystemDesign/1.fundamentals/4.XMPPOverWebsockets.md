### XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
- A messaging protocol built on top of XML.
- Designed for real-time communication, such as chat, presence (online/offline status), and group messaging.
- Traditionally runs over TCP (port 5222).

### WebSocket
- A transport protocol that enables full-duplex (two-way) communication between a client (usually a browser) and a server over a single TCP connection.
- Typically runs over port 80 (ws) or 443 (wss).
- It’s not a messaging protocol by itself — it’s just a way to send and receive data efficiently in real time.

### 🔗 Relationship Between XMPP and WebSocket
- XMPP and WebSocket relate as application-layer vs. transport-layer concepts:
- Layer	Protocol	Role
- Transport	WebSocket	Handles real-time, bidirectional data transport
- Application	XMPP	Defines the message format, semantics, and routing logic

So, XMPP can run over WebSocket, just like it traditionally runs over TCP.

### Think of it like this:
- WebSocket = the “pipe” (how data flows)
- XMPP = the “language” spoken through that pipe
- So, XMPP over WebSocket means “speaking XMPP” through a modern, browser-friendly transport.
