### Partition Tolerance (P)
- Partition tolerance means:
   - The system can survive network failures that split the cluster into isolated groups (called partitions).
   - Even if messages between some nodes are lost, delayed, or dropped, the system still functions in some way.

### In real-world distributed systems, network partitions are unavoidable (because networks can fail, packets can be dropped, etc.).
- That’s why Partition Tolerance is not optional — any distributed system must handle it.

### Example
- Imagine you have 3 servers in different regions:
   - Server A (India)
   - Server B (US)
   - Server C (Europe)

- Now the India ↔ US link goes down (partition).

- Partition Tolerance = The system still keeps working, even if some servers can’t talk to each other.
