-  now that we are builing e-com website for selling t shirts
-  we need some web pages (downloaded and displayed by browser , described by using html, css and javascript)
-  now page will have some basic features like login logout, create new account
-  now the question is where will we host these pages , in serverless or another option as CDN

### Lets talk about choosing between these two
- well CDNs are globally distributed will have low latency , serverless will be more expensive
- so what we can do we can keep statfic file in CDNs and video , images files can be kept in CDNs
- where as dynamic data will be kept in serverless , why so , lets say we have 50 tshirt of one type which needs to be sold across different region we , 40 booked in india and 11 booked in us
- then when db reconcile and by the time they talk to each other db remaining tshirt will become -1
- CDNs are slower in case of dynamic data to be updated hence dynamic data will be kept in serverless server

### How do we add files to CDN
- servers are distributed across the globe how do we add files to these servers
- is there a easy way to do it , yes we can have a system where we will store our files and images basically all our static files , now once we did that CDNs will periodically update all the servers
- when we add a new file CDN will see ok new file with id which i dont have is added then let me add to all my server
- where are we storing this which machine , it could be AWS S3 (It is a distributed file system) there are option like hadoop file system
- we will use AWS S3 for storing files and static data, as it has high rates of durability and consistency
- what CDN will we use we can cloudfront also provided by AWS we can something else like CDN provided by AKAMAI

#### now we have our application runing

-  as of now with our previous implementation currently our website is pointing to shopify website , and i dont want that to happen how do i move my user to my website
-  well we need to understand how internet works , basically the moment when you hit the url of your website , it goes to your router and then goes to ISP then sees ok this domain belongs to which IP address
-  that will be figured out by DNS resolver , it will do dns query , it is basically the domain and ip , key value pair
-  and then using that ip address our website will be resolved hence we need to updated ip address of our domain in order to get the updated website

#### What kind of db you should use
- well if you dont know anything use any of the db
- but still you want to make a choice use SQL, as this is more mature , and tomorrow you want to do some analytics , you can simply hire any data analytics , queries will be simple now need to learn something db specific thing
- fidelity will be acheived in both the cases , simplicy SQL is simple , and cheaper that depends
