- now that our application is running fine , a few days later we noticed that many of our orders and payment failed for some reason
- as a developer we first should check the payment gateway , as payment gateway itself suggest 98% of the payment will have success and 2% will have failure
- which was correct now to track the issue and find out the failure , we need:
### logging service

- using logging service we can always query a order with orderid and track down the issue for any particular order (cloud watch a logging service)

### Observability and anomaly detection
- well tomorrow if our e-com team needs to know that which day sales is higher , demand of particular product , to do so we can implement Observability service
- there are some option that are already available like google analytics

### How reliable is our system
-  lets talk about how reliable is our system, is there a single point of failure , well for now almost everywhere we can see such issue if our serverless server goes down our application will go down customer will not be able to order, if our CDN goes down we will have nothing showing to user, if db goes down we wouldnt be able process any order
-  to improve we can have replications of db , for asw server (serverless) it will spin up another server so quickly 
-  what if shopify itself goes down , **this is a single point of failure** in such scenario it is important to show our customer a proper message , may data is not accessible please try again later

### how to avoid such problemsL:
- Redundancy (having multiple vendors/ providers) like multiple payment gateway stripe, razorpay, paypal, phonepe
- graceful degradation (Tell the customers that you are facing issues and inform them )

- with all the implementation above , it all looks good , but now you get the requirement from founder about new implementation
  - user should be able to try t-shirt at home in front of camera
  - real time video of photo rendering
- well for any new feature we should talk about cost of implementation how much is it going to take
- lets say we have 10000 users 10 out of 100 user will try t-shirt online
- with that cost will be 10000*10/100 = 1000 API calls of rendering video
- cost of storing all the data for analysis 1000 API call * 1 video (lets say video size 1 MB in S3 ) = 1000 * 1MB = 1GB per day
- this would be cost associated to bring the feature
- once we have estimated the cost , now may be we can optimize

### Few things which are important to discuss for feature 
- meet all the requirement
- simple
- Optimizations
